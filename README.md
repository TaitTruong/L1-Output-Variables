## Python
Python is an object-orientated language 

## Output 
Output is the way the computer prints information to the user in the "console"

To output we use `print()`

## Comments
Comments are notes that the compiler skips over 

To use comments, we use `# COMMENT` fpr single-line

we use `'''COMMENT'''` for block comments

## Data Types

We will be working witth 5 main data types

1. Integer (int) - whole numbers
2. Character (char) - a single letter/symbol/number
3. String (str) - collection of characters
4. Floating point (float) - decimal numbers
5. Boolean (bool) - True/False 1/0
## Variables
Variables are conatiners that hold a value 

### Rules for variable names
1. Always start with a letter
   `1name = "Tait" `--> NOT ALLOWED
2. can only conatain numbers, letters, and underscores (_) `my name = "Tait" ` --> NOT ALLOWED
3. If more than one word, use camelCase or underscores to seperate words
   `myFirstName` or `my_first_name`

   ##Cocatenation
   `+` Adding strings together, appending (add to end)

   `"Hello" + "World" = "Hello World"

   ## Type Cast
   Forcing a data type on a value

   ### to force an integer into a string
   `str(variableName)`

   ### To force a string into an integer
   `int(variableName)`
